This is a Guide designed not only as a minimalist guide for the most beginner but also a condensate of ready made guides and threads on many subject. This guide will only give you the most basic information, and redirect you to other more precise guides. MXLS is the most popular Diablo II overhaul modification, Median XL is an action RPG with extensive endgame content, deep character customization and challenging game-play. It offers thousands of new items, new skills for all classes, and multiple improvements to the Diablo II engine. MXLS is overwhelming at first. Most of it feels new, complex and a bit too much to chew on. Don't be scared. The best bit of advice there is when starting this mod for the first time, is to start with ANY chars and ANY build. Just get a feel of the game, and then, when you managed to get your char stuck in hell, start anew with your new acquired knowledge. IMPORTANT NOTICE This Guide DOES NOT intent on taking over either the official documentation nor the forum. Since this guide DOES NOT provide more information that what's already on the forum or Official Documentation , you WILL need to read both of them as this guide only encapsulate the bare minimum. In order to make any progress in this game you ABSOLUTELY need to read the official documentation. It hold most of the infos newbies are asking for.

Their skills are different, their ability to carry loot is different, etc For the intent of letting you experience the game by yourself, and in order to not bury you under too much information, we will not spoon feed you every single aspect of the different chars. You will have to discover them by yourself. Each chars have different builds that can be played and are viable. Some builds are more viable and/or noob friendly than others, and your best bet is to look into The Guide Center to make up your mind about them. That said if you insist, you can go to the 'What class to play' section of the Newbie guide or Seekers extremely good tiered list of builds SKILLS Skills are the meat of your build. Most work like in Diablo II with some notable changes. One key info is to read carefully the skill description. It will help you understand them. Skills are explained in the Docs, under the 'Character' tab. - Here is the amazon class with its skills explained. By clicking on the tab you can get to all 7 classes. Each level up give you a skill point to invest. You can reset your skill points 3 times ( one by difficulty level) after the first Act1 quest ( Akara reset). In later game, an item similar to the token of Absolution drops, and is able to do the same. They are called 'Belladonna'. Keep them. RESISTANCES AND DEFENCE In MXLS resistances are way more important than in Classic Diablo II. You should try to max out your resistances at all times. Here are the resistance penalties : - Normal = no res penalties - Nightmare = -30% resistance - Hell = -70% resistance At all point your max resistance is soft capped at 75% but it can be increased up to 90%. That value is 50% for physical resistance. You can socket either Onyx, Bloodstone, Amber or Turquoise to increase both your resistance but also your max resistance threshold. Defense dictate the ability of your char to not get hit. Try getting as much defense as possible alongside: Avoid%, Evade% and physical resistance. The player can run, but running decrease your defense to 0 (zero). Try to not run around mobs. MERCENARIES Mercenaries are pretty straight forward. Here is their documentation. Please note that mercenaries are always better when hired in Normal difficulty, yes, really. Every mercs are good, if provided they have good gear. Your goal is to build/choose a mercenary that complement your build or play-style. Often a user made guide will tell you the optimal mercs to choose from, but generally this isn't a game changer.","title":"Chars and Skills"},{"location":"characters/#characters","text":"All the Chars in MXL are completely different than classic Diablo II.

It is very clear and precise, and will help you grasp how they work. TU (Tiers Uniques) TUs have 4 ranks. Their stats requirement and general power depend on their stats. Check the docs for a list of them all, and their stats. You can turn useless TU into arcane shards (see the recipes up on that page) Be careful when up-tiering a tiered unique, the requirements can jump tremendously from one tier to the other. Always check the docs out first. You cannot reduce a TU tier, only up-tiering is possible. SU ( Sacred Uniques) SU are the next 'rank' of item. Generally better than T4 TU they are important for progressing in the game. Each item types has one SU and one SSU (sacred-sacred-unique). SU on the left, SSU on the right. A SSU isn't always better than an SU for your build. Read the documentation to check the item's stats and if they fit your build. Sometimes a simple TU with good stats is better than an useless SU! SU can be made into a token that add 1 (one) stat up when right clicking. Those are commonly referred as 'Sigs'. The maximum amount of sigs you can eat is 400. This is a sig \u2192 HONORIFICS AND MYSTIC ORBS Honorifics are special items that can be made with either TU or SU items. Their text appear green in the game. They can be made in the cube with any magic item + Mark of infusion = honorific Honorifics ( like any other items) can be cubed with Mystic Orbs (MO) one by one to transfer the MO stat to the item, except honorific gain double the amount of stats and have the maximum amount of sockets. Very handy if you don't find an item you need and want to get a lot of resistance/dexterity/stats on a glove, or boots. Use a base magic item with low lvl required since each MO adds a + 4 level required to the item. You can only apply up to 5 of the same type of regular Mystic Orb to your item. The mark of infusion is dropped by Shenk in act5. Honorifics can't be made before this act ( except if you transfer from another char/friend). MO can be brought from vendors, but they are very expensive. Around 13k each. MISC ABOUT ITEMS Hoarding item (gems, jewels, random crap) is useless in the beginning of the game. Here's a list of item you should try to keep early on: 1. Resistance gems (Onyx/Bloodstone/Amber/Turquoise) 1. A couple of random runes (For reroll purposes) 1. A couple jewel for recipes (keep ALL jewels that drop in hell for crafting) 1. The catalysts, belladonas, etc To get TU quicker (Check the recipes how to make any TU) you can farm Mephisto and then Nihlatak since both of them drops Arcane shards. Uber charms have some randomization when it come to the amount of stats they have. Sometime you'll need to farm the charms to get a better roll. TIPS Some maps have a drop bias towards specific types of items (check the doc). The best way to drop gems is K3K. Clear speed is better than MF in many cases.
