Just click 'Play on TSW', create an account, and voila. Now you can make a char and play with everyone. Gameservers The sin war is actually not only ONE server, but rather a buch of different servers hosted around the world. You can get an overview of their location, population and status on this page: Server status page You can select your default gameserver by using the command /gs <number>. Where 'number' is the refered gameserver's number on the server status page. It is recomended to use a server that is geographically close to you, for performances purposes. Can't play online? It might happend in rare occasions that you are unable to create a game, and get stuck on the loading animation or tell you you can't join the game. It might have happend because the GS got stuck and needs to be restarted, or he still thinks your character is still in the game. Waiting a bit, generally solves the issue. Hardcore or ladder?
