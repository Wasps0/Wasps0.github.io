## MONSTERS
  
Each areas have different monster level. It is better to kill monsters that are around your level. Aerial has made a recap list that is very [handy](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=22675&hilit=cow) (It's the text with colors around the middle of his post)
those are all the types of monsters:  

1. Regular Monsters &rarr; common and easy to kill
1. Elite Monsters &rarr; harder, gives more loot and xp
1. Veteran Monsters &rarr; dont exist anymore used to drop eyes
1. Uber Monsters &rarr; common uber level enemy, hard to kill
1. Super Unique Monsters &rarr; like in D2LoD, they are minibosses and bosses
1. Uber Bosses &rarr; increasingly tough, drop uber charm
	1. Dungeons
	2. Rifts


## LOOTS AND ITEMS ![el rune](../img/El_Rune.webp)

Items have specific stats that are needed to have before equipping them. Always keep a few stat point to be able to equip them at all times. Some items can only be equipped by specific chars, beware of that.  
Be careful before upgrading a TU item to its next tier, as the stats requirement are steep. Check their page for a indication of their stat requirements.

Look at the dexterity requirement from Tier3 to Tier4, its a huge step. Don't upgrade before checking the docs. More in the [Item section](https://wasps0.github.io/#items/).
