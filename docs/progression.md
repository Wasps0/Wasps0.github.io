## MONSTERS, CHARMS AND LEVELING
  
Each areas have different monster level. It is better to kill monsters that are around your level. 

Charms also have specific level requirement, here's some links to get a list of charms:  
+ [tsw charm list](https://tsw.vn.cz/quests/)  
+ Aerial's [recap list](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=22675&hilit=cow) (It's the text with colors around the middle of his post)  


Here's the quick recap for the EXP grind:  
+ EXP from lvl 1 to lvl 110: Just play the game normally  
+ EXP to get to lvl 110: IotSS / A5 Red portals / End of A5 / A5 Icy Cellar  
+ EXP to get to lvl 115: Torajan Jungles / Cow Level  
+ EXP to get to lvl 120: K3BA / Tran Athulua / Khalimgrad / Azmodan level  
+ EXP to get to lvl 125: Duncraig / Teganze / Triune  
+ EXP to get to lvl 140+: Fauztinville / Bremmtown / Vizjun / Toraja / Duncraig/ Lab  

Those are all the types of monsters:  

+ Regular Monsters &rarr; common and easy to kill
+ Elite Monsters &rarr; harder, gives more loot and xp
+ Veteran Monsters &rarr; dont exist anymore used to drop eyes
+ Uber Monsters &rarr; common uber level enemy, hard to kill
+ Super Unique Monsters &rarr; like in D2LoD, they are minibosses and bosses
+ Uber Bosses &rarr; increasingly tough, drop uber charm


## LOOTS AND ITEMS ![el rune](../img/El_Rune.webp)

Items have specific stats that are needed to have before equipping them. Always keep a few stat point to be able to equip them at all times. Some items can only be equipped by specific chars, beware of that.  
Be careful before upgrading a TU item to its next tier, as the stats requirement are steep. Check their page for a indication of their stat requirements.  
![](../img/tu.webp)  
Look at the dexterity requirement from Tier3 to Tier4, its a huge step. Don't upgrade before checking the docs. More in the [Item section](https://wasps0.github.io/#items/).
