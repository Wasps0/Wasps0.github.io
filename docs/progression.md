## KILL MONSTERS ![cog gif](../img/cog.webp)
  
Each areas have different monster level. It is better to kill monsters that are around your level. Aerial has made a recap list that is very [handy](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=22675&hilit=cow) (It's the text with colors around the middle of his post)


## LOOTS AND ITEMS ![el rune](../img/El_Rune.webp)

Items have specific stats that are needed to have before equipping them. Always keep a few stat point to be able to equip them at all times. Some items can only be equipped by specific chars, beware of that.  
Be careful before upgrading a TU item to its next tier, as the stats requirement are steep. Check their page for a indication of their stat requirements.

Look at the dexterity requirement from Tier3 to Tier4, its a huge step. Don't upgrade before checking the docs.
