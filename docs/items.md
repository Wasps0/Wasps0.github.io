# TU, SU, Sets, Runewords, jewels...

The first section of each type of item [Official Documentation](https://docs.median-xl.com/) is very clear and precise, read the link first.

Items are subjected to being used in recipes, especially powerful ones. Check the [Cube Recipe section](https://docs.median-xl.com/doc/items/cube)!

# Misc about SU

Each item types has one SU and one SSU (sacred-sacred-unique). SU on the left, SSU on the right.

A SSU isn't alway better than an SU for your build. Read the documentation to check the item's stats and if they fit your build.

Sometimes a simple TU with good stats is better than an inadapted SU!
