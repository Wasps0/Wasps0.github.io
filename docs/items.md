# CRAFTING

Visit [this thread](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=19419) for an in depth yet clear guide on crafting  
And this one for the [cube recipes docs](https://docs.median-xl.com/doc/items/cube).  
Items are subjected to being used in recipes, especially powerful ones, check the cube docs to know them all.

# TU, SU, Sets, Runewords, jewels...

The first section of each type of item [Official Documentation](https://docs.median-xl.com/) is very clear and precise, read the link first.

## MISC ABOUT TU

TUs have 4 ranks. Their stats requirement and general power depend on their stats. Check the [docs](https://docs.median-xl.com/doc/items/tiereduniques#idx0) for a list of them all, and their stats.

## MISC ABOUT SU

SU are the next 'rank' of item. Generally better than T4 TU they are important for progressing in the game.
Each item types has one SU and one SSU (sacred-sacred-unique). SU on the left, SSU on the right.

A SSU isn't always better than an SU for your build. Read the documentation to check the item's stats and if they fit your build.

Sometimes a simple TU with good stats is better than an useless SU!
