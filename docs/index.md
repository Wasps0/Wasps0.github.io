# THE MOD

Welcome to the Unofficial Beginner Guide for MedianXL Sigma (MXLS) . This is a Guide designed as the most basic entry for a medianXL beginner. It will allow you to jump fresh into the game and *hopefuly* not feel *too* overwhelmed.  
MXLS, compared to diablo II LoD, is a complete overhaul. This means nearly every aspect of the original game has been either modified, improved, added and some, deleted.

MXLS is overwhelming at first. Most of it feels new, complex and a bit too much to chew on. Don't be scared.  
The best bit of advice there is when you start this mod for the first time, is to start with **ANY** chars and **ANY** build. Just get a feel of the game, and then, when you managed to get your char stuck in hell, start anew with your new acquired knowledge.

# READ ME

This Guide ***DOES NOT*** intent on taking over either the official documentation nor the forum. Since this guide ***DOES NOT*** provide more information that what's already on the forum or [Official Documentation](https://docs.median-xl.com/), you ***WILL*** need to read both of them as this guide only encapsulate the bare minimum.


In order to make any progress in this game you ***ABSOLUTELY*** need to read the official documentation. It hold most of the infos newbies are asking for. Especially the [Cube Recipe section](https://docs.median-xl.com/doc/items/cube)  
I cannot stress this enough.
