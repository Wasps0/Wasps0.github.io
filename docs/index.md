# THE GUIDE/THE MOD

Welcome to the Unofficial Beginner Guide for MedianXL Sigma (MXLS) . This is a Guide designed not only as a minimalist guide for the most beginner but also a condensate of ready made guides and treads on many subject.  

This guide will only give you the most basic information, and redirect you to other more precise guides.  

MXLS is the most popular Diablo II overhaul modification, Median XL is an action RPG with extensive endgame content, deep character customization and challenging game-play. It offers thousands of new items, new skills for all classes, and multiple improvements to the Diablo II engine.

MXLS is overwhelming at first. Most of it feels new, complex and a bit too much to chew on. Don't be scared.  
The best bit of advice there is when starting this mod for the first time, is to start with **ANY** chars and **ANY** build. Just get a feel of the game, and then, when you managed to get your char stuck in hell, start anew with your new acquired knowledge.


# IMPORTANT NOTICE

This Guide ***DOES NOT*** intent on taking over either the official documentation nor the forum. Since this guide ***DOES NOT*** provide more information that what's already on the forum or [Official Documentation](https://docs.median-xl.com/), you ***WILL*** need to read both of them as this guide only encapsulate the bare minimum.


In order to make any progress in this game you ***ABSOLUTELY*** need to read the official documentation. It hold most of the infos newbies are asking for. Especially the [Cube Recipe section](https://docs.median-xl.com/doc/items/cube)  
I cannot stress this enough.
