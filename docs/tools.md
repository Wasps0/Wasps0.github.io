## LANGUAGES

The official language of the game is English. That said there is a translator community who made the game available in russian, french, chinese, spanish, and other languges. [Our official thread](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=22977&hilit=sigma+translations) list every up to date languages.

## ACCESSIBILITY

If you suffer from Color blindness, vision impairment or shitty screen colors syndrome, there is an in-game setting that allow to mark rare/unique/sets with an added text marker.  

Additionally, if like me, the in-game font isn't very readable you can swap for another ready made font. The installation process is less straight forward but not very complex. [Here is my guide](https://gitlab.com/Wasps/diablo-2-fonts/-/blob/master/installing.md) and personal page to get all the different font we've made
