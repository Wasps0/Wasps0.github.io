## What are sacred items?

Sacred uniques, commonely refered as SU and SSU are MXLS's most elite items. They too have ranks, like TUs.
Check the [documentation](https://docs.median-xl.com/doc/items/sacreduniques) for a precise reference about them.

Each item types has one SU and one SSU (sacred-sacred-unique). SU on the left, SSU on the right.

A SSU isn't alway better than an SU for your build. Read the documentation to check the item's stats and if they fit your build.

Sometimes a simple TU with good stats is better than an inadapted SU!
