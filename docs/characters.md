# Characters

All the Chars in MXL are completely different that classic Diablo II. Their skills are differents, their ability to carry loot is different, etc

For the intent of letting you experience the game by yourself, and in order to not burry you under too much information, we will not spoon feed you every single aspect of the different chars. You will have to discover them by yourself. Each chars have different builds that can be played and are viable. Some builds are more viable and/or noob friendly than others, and your best bet is to look into [The Guide Center](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewforum.php?f=40) to make up your mind about them.
