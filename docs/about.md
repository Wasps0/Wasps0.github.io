# ABOUT ME
I started to play the mod in 2016, and loved it instantly. Although I play less often now, I am still around to see how the mod evolve. I have made other contributions to the mod such as the [french translation](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=22977&hilit=sigma+translations) and [custom fonts + guides](https://gitlab.com/Wasps/diablo-2-fonts).    
Outside the game, I did other translation jobs for another video-game (dungeon keeper FX, not professionally) but I'd like to make more game available in french.
