# Playing online

Playing on MXLS's servers (The sin war) is extremely easy. Just click 'Play on TSW', create an account, and voila. Now you can make a char and play with everyone.

The sin war is actually not only **ONE** server, but rather a bunch of different servers hosted around the world. You can get an overview of their location, population and status on this page:

[Server status page](https://tsw.median-xl.com/info)

You can select your default gameserver by using the command `/gs <number>.` Where 'number' is the referred gameserver's number on the server status page.

It is recommended to use a server that is geographically close to you, for performances purposes.
