# PLAYING ONLINE

Playing on MXLS's servers (The sin war) is extremely easy. Just click 'Play on TSW', create an account, and voila. Now you can make a char and play with everyone.

## GAMESERVERS

The sin war is actually not only **ONE** server, but rather a bunch of different servers hosted around the world. You can get an overview of their location, population and status on this page:

[Server status page](https://tsw.median-xl.com/info)

You can select your default gameserver by using the command `/gs <number>.` Where 'number' is the referred gameserver's number on the server status page.

It is recommended to use a server that is geographically close to you, for performances purposes.

## TRADING

MXLS has a [trading utility](https://forum.median-xl.com/tradegold.php?sid=71ce81633479ebafa992937ba32af6eb) that can be used to trade fictional gold (Tg) for items. Either buy an item with Tg or sell them for Tg.  
Tg can be brought by making a [donation](https://forum.median-xl.com/donate.php), and are mandatory for using the Trade center

It might happens in rare occasions that you are unable to create a game, and get stuck on the loading animation or tell you you can't join the game. It might have happen because the GS got stuck and needs to be restarted, or he still thinks your character is still in the game. Waiting a bit, generally solves the issue.

## HARDCORE OR LADDER?

Play hardcore if you feel like it. No pressure. When dead, your char get transferred to ladder anyway, so why not try üòè
